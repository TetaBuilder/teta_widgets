## First a family, then a team.
For us, well-being as a person is the first thing. We care our community continues to be a place free from any kind of discrimination (gender, sexual orientation, religion, culture, etc.) or incitement to hatred.
We are an international team, where 50% of the team identifies as female, and we have an average age of 23.
